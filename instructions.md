# How to use this toy

This page runs a **Monte Carlo** simulation of your pension pot. It uses your assumptions (current age, contributions, retirement rules, pensions, university costs, and gifts) and thousands of random market return paths to see how often your money lasts to 90. IT IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE AND SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED WITH ANYTHING IMPORTANT.

## Steps

1. **Set your assumptions** in the left panel. Use the sliders or type numbers directly.
2. **Click "Run simulation"** to run thousands of scenarios. Results and the chart update when it finishes.
3. **Read the summary** (e.g. % of runs where money lasts to 90, median retirement age, median estate at 90).
4. **Use the chart** to see portfolio value over time (hover for values). Set "Chart Y-axis max" if you want to zoom.

## Key assumptions

- **Current age** — Age at which the simulation starts (you have the starting pot and contribute each year until retirement).
- **Retirement** — You retire in the first year when you are between *Earliest* and *Latest* retirement age **and** either your pot reaches the *Retirement threshold* or you hit *Latest* age.
- **Withdrawal** — After retirement, you take an amount each year so that *total income* (pot withdrawal + pensions) is between *Income floor* and *Income ceiling*, using the *Withdrawal rate* as a guide.
- **Children** — Set how many children (0–4), then for each child choose whether they go to uni (and when they turn 18) and whether they get a gift (and at what age you give it).
- **Uni costs/year** and **Gift amount** — Applied only to children who have "Goes to uni" or "Gets gift" checked.

All figures are in **today’s pounds** (real terms). This is not financial advice.
